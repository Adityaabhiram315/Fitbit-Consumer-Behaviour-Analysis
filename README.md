# Fitbit Fitness Tracker App Data Analysis 🏃‍♂️💤

## Overview 📊

This project aims to analyze Fitbit Fitness Tracker App data to gain insights into how consumers use the Fitbit app and discover trends and insights for the marketing team. The analysis includes exploring various datasets such as daily activity, hourly activity, minutes activity, sleep data, weight log, and heart rate.

## Business Objectives 🎯

- Identify trends in Fitbit app usage.
- Understand how these trends apply to customers.
- Utilize identified trends to influence marketing strategy.

## Data Sources 📂

The data used in this analysis was collected from Fitbit users who consented to submit their personal tracker data. The dataset includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Data was collected between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 via a distributed survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation 🧹🔧

- The dataset underwent cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Data was merged and transformed to create consolidated datasets for daily, hourly, and minutes activity.
- Pandas Profiling was utilized for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Analysis Summary 📝🔍

- Explored trends in daily, hourly, and minutes activity.
- Analyzed sleep patterns and duration.
- Examined weight log trends and fluctuations.
- Investigated heart rate variations and trends.

## Visualizations and Key Findings 📊🔑

- Utilized matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
- Identified peak activity times during the day.
- Discovered correlations between sleep duration and activity levels.
- Highlighted fluctuations in weight log over time.
- Examined changes in heart rate during different activities.

## Content Recommendations 📌💡

- Based on the analysis, recommendations could include:
  - Tailoring marketing campaigns to peak activity times.
  - Promoting features related to improving sleep quality.
  - Providing personalized recommendations based on activity and heart rate data.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- Python for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, and Data Analysis.
- Pandas Profiling for initial EDA.

- Understand how these trends apply to customers.
- Utilize identified trends to influence marketing strategy.

## Data Sources 📂

The data used in this analysis was collected from Fitbit users who consented to submit their personal tracker data. The dataset includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Data was collected between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 via a distributed survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation 🧹🔧

- The dataset underwent cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Data was merged and transformed to create consolidated datasets for daily, hourly, and minutes activity.
- Pandas Profiling was utilized for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Business Objectives 🎯

- Identify trends in Fitbit app usage.
- Understand how these trends apply to customers.
- Utilize identified trends to influence marketing strategy.

## Data Sources 📂

The data used in this analysis was collected from Fitbit users who consented to submit their personal tracker data. The dataset includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Data was collected between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 via a distributed survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation 🧹🔧

- The dataset underwent cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Data was merged and transformed to create consolidated datasets for daily, hourly, and minutes activity.
- Pandas Profiling was utilized for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Analysis Summary 📝🔍

- Explored trends in daily, hourly, and minutes activity.
- Analyzed sleep patterns and duration.
- Examined weight log trends and fluctuations.
- Investigated heart rate variations and trends.

## Visualizations and Key Findings 📊🔑

- Utilized matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
- Identified peak activity times during the day.
- Discovered correlations between sleep duration and activity levels.
- Highlighted fluctuations in weight log over time.
- Examined changes in heart rate during different activities.

## Content Recommendations 📌💡

- Based on the analysis, recommendations could include:
  - Tailoring marketing campaigns to peak activity times.
  - Promoting features related to improving sleep quality.
  - Providing personalized recommendations based on activity and heart rate data.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- Python for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, and Data Analysis.
- Pandas Profiling for initial EDA.
